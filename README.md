# Fantasy-DnD-Calendar
An automated calendar to keep track of the day in your DnD game.
It creates a .txt document in Users and stores the current date, allowing you to increase in 1-day increments by pressing enter.
The calendar uses a 360 day system for simplicity and tells date in terms of day, week, month, and year (10 days to a week, 3 weeks to a month, 12 months to a year).

# Futue Plans
1. Allow the user to go forward or backward by any number of days, rather than just increasing by 1 each time
1. Identify useless/repeated portions of the code and eliminate it (make it look clean and pretty)
1. Attach a weather system to the calendar that randomly determines the weather for that date depending on season
    1. Make the weather vary depending on enter longitude/latitude as well
